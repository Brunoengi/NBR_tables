<h1>Project under development</h1>

<p>The objective of this project is to build an integrated Backend/API application that allows other programmers to dynamically build models to replicate the structures of Brazilian standards (NBR) tables, to later use the data in JSON format.</p>

<h3>How to do:</h3>

<p><b>Backend:</b> 

- Creation of templates to work with the mongoose library and create models and controllers dynamically through Node's filesystem module. 
- Creation of search methods if the user wanted to use JS to convert JSON files into project variables.
<br><br>

<b>API:</b>
- Data manipulation using http methods to create, read, update and delete using table keys as reference parameter.
- Organizing the data in a structure that has a portion that is common to all collections with information such as name, id and page in the reference standard and a portion that is its uniqueness.
<br><br>

<b>Database:</b> 
- Each database is a Brazilian standard, we are using mongodb.
